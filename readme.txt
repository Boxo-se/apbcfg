Box's config 1.3

I will not take any responsibility for anyone that uses this config.
Use on your own discretion

QnA

Will I make any changes to this?
No.

How do you apply the config? 
Drag and drop the files in x\Steam\steamapps\common or use the config loader included. 

What does CFGL.bat do?
Since I use 3 different configs I've made a bat file to switch between them quickly. 
All it does is copy the files from destination x to y. You can use it by chaning the path ways.

Will you answer questions about the config or the config loader.
No, I dont intend to maintane this or share newer configs. This is only to share the little I have.

Whats included in all variants?
Hold to crouch, Autosprint, Black sky for Fin and WF, Jmilos input changes, Lazers graphics and localisation changes made by me with the help of Lazer.
