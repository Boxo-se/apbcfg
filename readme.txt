Use your own discretion
I will not take any responsibility for anyone that uses this config.


QnA

Will I make any changes to this?
No.

How do you apply the config? 
Drag and drop the files in x\Steam\steamapps\common or use the config loader included. 

What does CFGL.bat do?
Since I use 3 different configs I've made a bat file to switch between them quickly. 
All it does is copy the files from destination x to y. You can use it by chaning the path ways.
